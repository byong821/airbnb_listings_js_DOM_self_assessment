# JavaScript and DOM Self Assessment

FA 2025 Web Development

## Meaningful Changes:
In addition to adding the page displaying/loading the first 50 listings from the provided JSON file using AJAX, I also included additional helpful information to a customer such as number of reviews, availability, bedrooms, etc. 

Another meaningful implementation that I included, was implementing a button to populate the next 50 listings upon pressing it, found at the bottom after the uploaded listings.
